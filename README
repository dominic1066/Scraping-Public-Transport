scripts to capture wellington bus times, by bus stop.

needs lxml and gtfs-realtime-bindings to be installed.

gtfsscraperv0.4.py was salvaged from Hashigo Zake where we used it to create a file called times.xml, containing
the buses en route to any of three nearby bus stops. It would then be uploaded by ftp to our web server so that
pages (such as our on-screen menu) could incorporate bus info the the benefit of customers.
